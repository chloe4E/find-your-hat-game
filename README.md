# find-your-hat-game

This game is one of the project of codecademy.

>Your game should be playable by users. In order to facilitate this, build out the following behavior:
>
>When a user runs main.js, they should be prompted for input and be able to indicate which direction they’d like to “move”.
>After entering an instruction, the user should see a printed result of their current field map with the tiles they have visited marked with *. They should be prompted for their next move.
>This should continue until the user either:

>Wins by finding their hat.
>Loses by landing on (and falling in) a hole.
>Attempts to move “outside” the field.
>When any of the above occur, let the user know and end the game.

>Add a .generateField() method to your Field class. This doesn’t need to be tied to a particular instance, so make it a static method of the class itself.

>This method should at least take arguments for height and width of the field, and it should return a randomized two-dimensional array representing the field with a hat and one or more holes. In our solution, we added a third percentage argument used to determine what percent of the field should be covered in holes.
